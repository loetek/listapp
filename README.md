# listapp
A simple and straight forward todo app. 


User Requirements
Create a web application (only locally available -- not publicly deployed on the internet) that is a
“to do list” for a local user. A user should be able to perform the following actions:
1. Create a new to do item.
2. Mark a to do item as done.
3. Delete a to do item permanently.
4. Filter to do items based on the input of a search bar.

List items should persist so that if the page is closed and reopened, the list is populated with the
previous contents.
The to do list should be attractively styled and intuitive.
Technical Requirements
1. Project should be a React SPA.
2. Use create-react-app to instantiate this project.
a. Be sure to use Typescript with strict mode enabled.
3. Use bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) or Material UI (https://material-ui.com/)
components where applicable, for clean styling.
4. Use local storage to persist list data.
5. Be sure to use Promises & async/await instead of callbacks.
6. Use functional react hook components instead of class based components.
7. We are looking for efficient and clean code that could easily be picked up by another
developer.
8. Use git to submit this project. Submit by sending a URL for which a user can run the
following to get your project running locally:

> git clone <your url> listapp
> cd listapp
> npm install
> npm run start
